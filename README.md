## 1. Title and Description

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems implemented in Python. It serves as a personal log of my progress and understanding of different data structures and algorithms. Each solution is accompanied by comments explaining the logic and rationale behind the approach.  The goal is to provide clear, concise, and well-documented code that can be easily understood and potentially used as a reference. I strive for optimal or near-optimal solutions whenever possible, focusing on both time and space complexity.

## 2. Features

*   **Comprehensive Coverage:**  Solutions covering a wide range of LeetCode problems, from Easy to Hard difficulty levels.
*   **Clean and Readable Code:**  Well-structured Python code with consistent formatting and meaningful variable names.
*   **Detailed Comments:**  Explanations within the code describing the problem-solving approach, algorithm used, and key implementation details.
*   **Optimized Solutions:** Solutions aim for optimal or near-optimal time and space complexity.  Where applicable, alternative solutions with different trade-offs are included.
*   **Organized Structure:** Problems are organized by topic and difficulty level to facilitate easy navigation.
*   **Continuous Updates:** The repository is regularly updated with new solutions and improvements to existing ones.
*   **Clear Problem Statement Link:** Each solution includes a direct link to the original problem on LeetCode.

## 3. Installation

Since this repository primarily contains Python code, installation mainly involves setting up a Python environment.

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.7 or higher (recommended) installed on your system.
    *   A code editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).

*   **Steps:**

    1.  **Clone the Repository:**

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/leetcode.git
        cd leetcode
        ```

    2.  **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment:**

        It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
        # venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
        ```

    3.  **(Optional) Install Dependencies (if any):**

        If your solutions rely on external libraries (although most LeetCode problems don't), install them using pip:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt # if a requirements.txt file exists
        ```

## 4. Usage

Navigate to the directory containing the solution you want to run.  Each solution is typically a standalone Python file.

*   **Running a Solution:**

    ```bash
    python path/to/your/solution.py
    ```

    For example:

    ```bash
    python array/easy/two_sum.py
    ```

    Each solution file is designed to be executed directly, and usually includes example test cases within the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block for verification.

## 5. API/Components Documentation (if applicable)

This repository focuses on solving LeetCode problems. It does not contain a formal API or reusable components intended for external use. The individual solutions are self-contained implementations of specific algorithms and data structures. Therefore, there's no dedicated API documentation section. Each solution's internal logic is explained through code comments.

## 6. Configuration

There's no specific configuration required to run the solutions in this repository. The solutions are designed to be self-contained and do not rely on external configuration files or environment variables.

## 7. Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug, have a better solution to a problem, or want to add a new solution, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the Repository:**  Create your own fork of this repository on GitHub.
2.  **Create a Branch:**  Create a new branch for your contribution.  Name it descriptively (e.g., `fix-two-sum-bug` or `add-binary-tree-solution`).
3.  **Implement Your Changes:**  Make your changes, ensuring the code is well-documented and follows the existing style guidelines.  Include tests to verify your solution's correctness.
4.  **Commit Your Changes:**  Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message.
5.  **Push to Your Fork:**  Push your branch to your forked repository.
6.  **Create a Pull Request:**  Submit a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository.

**Contribution Guidelines:**

*   **Code Style:**  Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
*   **Documentation:**  Provide clear and concise comments within the code to explain the logic and rationale behind your solution.
*   **Testing:**  Include test cases to verify the correctness of your solution.
*   **Commit Messages:**  Write clear and informative commit messages.
*   **Originality:** Solutions should be your own work or modifications of existing solutions, properly attributed where applicable.
